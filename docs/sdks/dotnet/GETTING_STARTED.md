## Getting Started

### Initialize & Make API Request
Once you have installed the package, it is extremely easy to get started with the SDK; all you need to do is import the package in your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:

```csharp
using Appwrite;

var client = new Client()
  .SetEndpoint("http://cloud.appwrite.io/v1")  // Make sure your endpoint is accessible
  .SetProject("5ff3379a01d25")                 // Your project ID
  .SetKey("cd868db89")                         // Your secret API key
  .SetSelfSigned();                            // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert

var users = new Users(client);

var user = await users.Create(
    userId: ID.Unique(),
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password",
    name: "name");

Console.WriteLine(user.ToMap());
```

### Error Handling
The Appwrite .NET SDK raises an `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```csharp
var users = new Users(client);

try {
    var user = await users.Create(
        userId: ID.Unique(),
        email: "email@example.com",
        password: "password",
        name: "name");
} catch (AppwriteException e) {
    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
}
```
